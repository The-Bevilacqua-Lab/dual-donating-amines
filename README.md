# Dual-Donating Amines

This Snakemake workflow mines RNA-containing structures retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), identifies 
nucleobases that contain non-, single-, and dual-donating amines, and then performs a variety of analyses. To reduce 
the redundancy of structures, the workflow was designed to source information from csv files created by BGSU's 
[Representative Sets of RNA 3D Structures](https://rna.bgsu.edu/rna3dhub/nrlist). The preprint for the paper 
corresponding to this workflow can be accessed through bioRxiv at https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.06.05.658080.
